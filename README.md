# RoK Talents (Issues Repo)

[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/sho-87/rok-talents-issues "Issues")](https://github.com/sho-87/rok-talents-issues/issues) [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20coffee-donate-blue "Donate")](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonho)

Online talent builder for Rise of Kingdoms. The talent builder itself can be found here: [roktalents.com](https://www.roktalents.com)

**Note**: The site is currently best viewed on PC or laptop. Functionality is limited on mobile/tablet and more work needs to be done to optimize the experience for mobile devices.

This website has 2 main purposes:

 1. Design and fine-tune your commander talents without worrying about resetting in-game talents
 2. Make it easy to share your talent builds with other players

## :smile: Usage

 1. Choose your commander in the top-right dropdown menu, or by clicking on the commander image in the middle of the talent tree
 2. Click talent nodes to bring up the tooltip. Click `+` and `-` to add/remove talents points
    - If `Speed mode` is enabled in the `Settings`, you can left or right click directly on the nodes to assign talent points. **Note:** Speed mode disables tooltips
 3. Check the stats of your build in the info panels
 4. Copy the URL, or click the `Share` button, to get a link that you can share with other players

## :confused: Getting help

If you have questions, feature requests, or bug reports, the first thing to do is browse issues posted by other players to see if your problem has been addressed. Issues can be found [here](https://github.com/sho-87/rok-talents-issues/issues).

If you still have questions, create a `New Issue` on the issues page.

## :grin: Contribute

There are a number of ways to help and contribute to the project:

- Submit a `New Issue` to report a bug or request a new feature
- The game changes rapidly, so if talents are out of date on the website, submit a `New Issue`
- Spread the word! Share your talent builds on social media (e.g. Reddit, Discord) and direct people to the site
